<strong>Our Use of Your Information
</strong><br/><br/>
We may disclose Your Information to our service providers (which could be located outside the US) for the purpose of providing you with our services.

If we search against the files of credit reference agencies, they will record the search and hence the way in which you conduct your account with us may be shared with other lenders and credit agencies.
 <br /><br />
Some of Your Information may be considered "sensitive personal data" under the Privacy Acts. We would require your positive consent for us to use such information, and we will do all that is reasonably practicable to draw this to your attention when you first supply us with Your Information. By asking you to click the I ACCEPT "terms & conditions" button at the time you first supply us Your Information via our website and by ticking the check-box at the time you first supply us with Your Information, you agree to the fact that we can retain this information for the primary use of conducting business.
