<strong>About</strong><br />

Cowtown is a Private 80 acre range comprised of hills and valleys and a variety of flat ranges and bays located in Peoria Arizona just south of Lake Pleasant, adjacent to the Agua Fria River and surrounded by State Land. The terrain is a mixture of washes, open spaces and hills that accommodates camouflage, tracking, K9 exercises and advanced night vision exercises. None of these training missions are feasible on traditional flat shooting ranges. Cowtown Range has been the home to many of America's most elite tactical operators for their training needs for over 15 years which is why we have the title of  â€œThe Most Famous Range Nobody Has Heard ofâ€?. Every step on our range is an elevation change which creates an advantageous venue for training; â€œPrecision Tactics for Managing Conflict at A Distanceâ€?.<br />

<strong>Cowtown Range and Training Facility</strong><br />

Today, the Ghost Town remains and the surrounding 88 acres serves as a training ground for 2 sniper and weapon training schools as well as being a training site for many Private Contractors, DOD, Law Enforcement and Military training groups. Cowtown Range is the "Most Famous Range Nobody Has Heard of". This training is all performed on the West Range utilizing the Afghan Village and long range target lanes as well as washes and hills and valleys. The unique terrain on the West Range provides challenging target acquisition as each step is an elevation change. The East Range is a flat, open area and consists of 6 Bays, (2) 100 yard ranges, a large Shoot house and 2 rifle ranges.<br />
<br />


<strong>Cowtown Studios</strong><br />

Cowtown Studios caters to a wide range of events and venues from specialized training to corporate events as well as filming opportunities. Cowtown Studios consists of several old movie sets including an old Ghost Town and Mexican or Afghan style village. The natural patina and textures of the materials and structures found on site make Cowtown Studios highly desirable for Casting Location Scouts and photographers. The Cowtown Management Group is currently seeking additional Clubs and User Groups to set up at Cowtown. Additional space is available near the Cowtown Cowboy Action Shooters or on the East Range which is a much flatter elevation and ideally suited for Clubs and User Groups. Additional bays have been developed as well as a long range shooting lane capable of facilitating shooters out to 250 yards.<br />

<br />


<strong>Hazard Zone Medical</strong><br />

This course allows opportunity for the operator without formal medical training to be able to provide immediate care to patients during any phase of tactical situations. Our curriculum consists of basic medical & trauma training in hazardous conditions and teaches all participants how to effectively treat the wounded with minimal medical equipment as well as basic self-care and basic buddy aid.

   <strong>"The most famous range you never heard of."</strong><br />   
  Many of America's most elite tactical operators been quietly training over the past few years at a place you probably never heard of: Cowtown, Arizona... Not exactly a household name in the shooting world, but a sampling of customers who use Cowtown includes US Army Special Forces, Rangers and National Guard Units, Air force Special Operations, Marine Recon and Scout Snipers, US Coast Guard law enforcement and sniper units, US Navy SEAL teams, including Seal Team Six, several federal agencies, including the FBI, Pentagon Police, US Marshalls, DHS, Department of Energy (nuclear security) and some "three letter" agencies that avoid publicity. Police special units include Las Vegas Swat, LAPD, LA County Swat, Phoenix SAU, and several dozen others <br /><br />
So what does Cowtown have to offer that motivates these elite organizations to come from States across America for training?  To begin with, it's close in still but out of sight, offers flexible day or night shooting schedules, looks a lot like Afghanistan and provides training support by veteran combat marksmen.<br /><br /> 
The Cowtown Range is approximately 80 acres of hills and valleys located in Peoria just south of Lake Pleasant, adjacent to the Agua Fria River and surrounded by State land. The terrain is a mixture of washes, open spaces and hills which accommodates camouflage, tracking, K-9 exercises and advanced night vision exercises. None of these training missions are feasible on traditional flat shooting ranges.<br /><br />
The property has a long history as a unique shooting facility.  In 1973, stuntman Ron Nix built Cowtown as a movie studio, general entertainment and shooting facility (mostly western style and fast draw competitions). Over the years, more than 200 movies were made here, including a few notable films such as Knight Rider 2010, Billy Jack and Dead Man with Johnny Depp.  The movie set buildings provide an environment much like an Afghan Village and the rough terrain permits "real world" challenges in the form of precision shooting at unusual angles and targeting in natural terrain. The range has been evaluated by GSA and approved as a federal shooting facility.<br /><br />
Cowtown was acquired in 1994 as an outdoor resource for our indoor range (Shooters World) and as a recreation and entertainment venue. From that time to the present Cowtown has hosted Movie and TV productions, Western Shooting Clubs, Corporate events, Shooting Competitions, Western Festivals and Tactical Firearms Training.<br /><br /> 
Some of the best Cowboy Action Shooters in America have called Cowtown  home since the Cowtown Cowboy Shooters  held the First Arizona State Championship of Cowboy Shooting in 1981 (now members of SASS).<br /><br />
The origins of tactical training begin approximately twelve years ago when Bill Graves (a former Shooter's World instructor) formed GPS Defense to teach precision marksmanship and military snipers. Early customers included SEAL teams and FBI (HRT) units.<br /><br /> 
The recognition of Cowtown as a significant contributor to Homeland Defense training is a significant point of pride for us and future training programs will include specialized Joint Operations Training for Disaster and Emergency Preparedness.<br /><br /> 
Current regular users and trainers include the Cowtown Cowboy Shooters Assn, Cowtown Paintball, GPS Defense, a leading provider of institutional security services, and. local gun manufactures McMillan Rifle and POF. Cowtown has also hosted classes conducted by many nationally recognized firearm trainers, including Rob Pincus, Travis Haley, Larry Vickers, Pat McNamara and Mike Lamb.<br /><br /> 
Cowtown will continue to provide a safe and secure facility to accommodate a large diversity of shooting styles. Although we are not currently able to accommodate individual shooters (who are not members of an existing club or training group), all our training groups have programs that include civilian students, at all levels of experience.<br /><br /> 
The Ben Avery Shooting Range, owned and operated by Arizona Fish and Game, is 8 miles east of Cowtown, and with over 250,000 shooters per year often gets pretty crowded.  Fish & Game executives recognize we are less busy and can offer considerably more flexibility in scheduling and types of shooting uses, and have been supportive in every possible way.<br /><br />

Richard Shaw is principal owner of Cowtown, a Co-founder of Shooters World, a lifetime member of NRA, past president of the Arizona Historical Society and an Arizona native.
